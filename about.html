      <h1>Who Am I</h1>

      <p>
        Hey! I'm Nathan, I am 20 years old, I live in Seattle, and I like learning about learning. I also like reading things in peoples' natural tone, so the tone of this will be a lot more casual than any post or paper. I got my Associate's with a focus in computer science from Bellevue college and will be transferring as a junior to the University of Washington this fall to study applied mathematics. I want to continue on to get my masters and P.h.d in computer science to then become an AI/ML researcher. What I really want is to create a model that can learn very similarly to humans; always perceiving, adjusting, and improving (well... relatively). I've been really excited to see research focussed on RL and language models become more popular. I'm currently focussing my learning on RL and RLHF to begin experimenting on a model that can perpetuallty be learning. I obsess over learning the most foundational concepts of anything I'm interested in, so mathemtical frameworks and proofs, mechanistic interpretability, and anything that has to do with understanding why certian models and architectures work fascinates me.

        ML is awesome, but so is/are:

        <ol>
          <li>God</li>
          <li>Cool People</li>
          <li>Snowboarding</li>
          <li>Philosophy</li>
          <li>Soccer (Liverpool & Barca fan)</li>
            <li>Bouldering</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Running</li>
          </li>
        </ol>
        And I'll gladly talk about any of these just as much as a good paper. As I wrap up, you're awesome, everyone has a cool story if you listen, and it's a little vulgar, but the link at the bottom of the page made me laugh and hopefully makes you laugh too.</p>
